# Lakka_Random_Game_Boot
Do you hate having to choose a game? Not sure what game you feel like playing when you start your emulation station?

This will pick a random rom file for the Lakka Linux Distro when you turn on your computer!

autostart.sh will need to be copied into /storage/.config/autostart.sh

I have placed random1.sh in /storage/roms/scripts/ (autostart.sh points to this.)

In the sub-folder  /storage/roms/scripts/run_scripts I have placed scripts to run specific roms that I like, random1.sh randomly picks one upon 
bootup.
